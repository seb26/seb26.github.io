Childcare workers, preschool workers and teachers gathered in Martin Place to criticise the federal and state governments' approaches to childcare funding, and to demand fairer pay.

The event was organised by the trade union United Voice and was mirrored by another rally in Melbourne.

Gatherers heard from deputy leader of the opposition Tanya Plibersek, NSW Labor MP Kate Washington, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Michele O'Neil, and organisers who shared stories of financial pressure.
