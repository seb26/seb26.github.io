  The march on Invasion Day marks 230 years since the British invasion on the continent and each year evokes traumatic reminders of brutal massacres, the separation of families during the Stolen Generation era, and the ongoing discrimination and disadvantaged faced by Aboriginal Australians in the present day.

More than 3,000 people rallied in support of rights for Australian Aboriginal people, bursting onto the streets from The Block in Sydney's Redfern. The Invasion Day march is held each year, with today marking 223 years since the British invasion on the continent. Young Aboriginal men performed traditional dances in the middle of one of Sydney's largest avenues, with the march then meeting the Yabun Festival in Victoria Park for music performances and talks by elders. Event organisers Fighting In Resistance Equally reported that the protestors' route was lined with "almost a kilometre of marchers".

Each year Invasion Day evokes traumatic reminders of brutal massacres, separations of families during the Stolen Generation era, and the ongoing discrimination and disadvantage faced by Aboriginal Australians in the present day. This month in the lead up to 26 January, debate sparked over a potential future change to the date of Australia's national public holiday has created significant divisions in the community and from both sides of politics.

The [red-yellow-black flag design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_Flag) is synonymous with Aboriginal Australian peoples, as its black (Aboriginal people), yellow (sun, giver of life) and red (earth) earth together signify cultural connection to the land and resistance.
