Device-adaptive design with lazy-loading loads rapidly and is suitable for mobile and desktops.

      Promotional site for an annual multimedia exhibition by Sydney-based art collective <em>SYNC!!</em>. The site used a single-page design to show event information and artist bios. Scrolling down the page triggered the headers and the perspective grid in the background to dynamically adapt in colour. Hand-coded. At the time the design did not make use of device-responsive styling, but its relative simplicity would make it readily adaptable to a framework package or basic @media queries.

  - title: Waveform-inspired mural
    url:
    date: 2015-06-23T02:31:36-04:00
    genre: Painting
    description: |
      Ambient music connecting my square-based creative space to the larger natural environment far outside my city, inaccessible when I haven't time. The waveform is a section of a track by French group M83, and the landscape detailing by <a href="http://lisaroberts.com.au">Lisa Roberts</a> depicts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_Tjuta">Kata Tjuta</a> ('the Olgas') rock formation in Northern Territory, Australia.
    material: |
      Biopaint, tint, oil-based permanent marker, pencil.
    technique: |
      Data projector used to display the preliminary digital design onto the wall for tracing. Its projecting position was adjusted in stages to eventually cover the wall. The waveform structure, which was drawn with ruler and pencil, extends across the entire ceiling.
    dimensions: "3 m × 3 m × 9 m"
